HISTORY OF LINUX:
========================
--> 1969: Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T’s Bell Labs created UNIX, a powerful, multiuser operating system.
--> UNIX became popular in universities and was the inspiration for many later operating systems, including Linux.
--> Linux was discovered by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
--> Linux is a Free, Open-source, Kernel operating System. Which uses the Systems, Services, Embedded System and Mobiles devices.
--> Linux is a Case-sensitive Operating System.

REQUIREMENTS TO LEARN LINUX:
================================
--> We need a good condition Laptop with Network.
--> To Connect Server we use Git Bash, PowerShell, Mobilex, Putty, Eclipse.
--> We need a AWS Account to create Instances.

LINUX DOCUMENTATION
== ** ===== ** ===============
--> There are two Essential tools for finding help and understanding how commands works in detail.

1) manual Pages (man)

Syntax:
-------

man [command name]

Ex:
---
man ls     # Shows the manual for the 'ls' command

Common Manual Page Sections:
----------------------------
Each man page may include:-

NAME - What the command does
SYNOPSIS - How to use it (Syntax)
DESCRIPTION - Detailed Explanation
OPTIONS - Lists of Flags/Switches
EXAMPLES - Sample Usage
SEE ALSO - Related Commands


2) --help 
--> Print a Quick Summary of options and Usage for a command

Syntax:
-------
command name --help

Ex:
---

ls --help       # Shows all available flags for 'ls'

When to use:
------------
When we need a quick overview of what options a command supports, without reading a full man page.

Difference Between man & Help:

DIRECTORIES UNDER /:
====================
	In Linux, the  / directory is known as the root directory. It is the top-level directory in the Linux File System hierarchy.
Every file and directory start from here - it is the parent of all directories.

Key Points about /(Root Directories):
=====================================
--> / is the base of entire Linux File System.
--> Everything - files, devices, mounted drives - is located under /.
--> Not to be confused with /root (Which is the home directory of root user).

common directories under /:
===========================

Directory                             Description
/bin                                  Essential binary executables (Ex:- ls, cp)

/root                                 Home directory of the root user.
/run                                  Running system data (Ex:- PIDs, sockets)
/sbin                                 system binaries(used by root user)
/srv                                  Data for services (Ex:- web servers)
/sys                                  Virtual filesystem related to devices.
/tmp                                  Temporary files(automatically cleared)
/usr                                  User programs, Libraries, and documentation.
/var                                  variable data like logs, mail and spool files.


BASIC LINUX COMMANDS:

GREP:
====
grep -i "wordname" "filename"         # It is used to find the word name in particular file from outside of vi/vim Editor.
grep -in "wordname" "filename"        # It is used to find the particular word and shows line number with matches.
grep -ic "wordname" "filename"        # It is used to find the particular word and count the number of matches.
grep -r "wordname" "filename"         # It is used to find the particular word in Directory.
grep -iv "wordname" "filename"        # It shows lines that do not match (Invert match)
grep -w  "wordname" "filename"        # It shows the match whole word only.
grep -il "wordname" "filename"        # It shows only filename with matches.
grep -iA5 "wordname" "filename"       # It prints 5 lines after the matching.
grep -iB5 "wordname" "filename"       # It prints 5 lines before the matching.
grep -iC5 "wordname" "filename"       # It prints 5 line before & after the matching.
grep -iE  "dog|cat" "filename"        # It matches either "dog" or "cat".
grep -i "^wordname" "filename"        # It is a regular expression that matches the line which start with "word name".
grep -i "wordname$" "filename"        # It is a regular expression that matches the line which ends with "word name".

WORD COUNT (wc):
================
wc   filename1    # It will display no.of lines in a file along with no.of characters with no.of words.
wc -l filename1   # It will display no.of lines inside the file.
wc -c filename1   # It will display no.of characters inside the file.
wc -w filename1   # It will display no.of words inside the file.


FIND:
======
--> The "find" command searches for files and directories recursively in a directly hierarchy based on conditions like name, size, time, type, permissions and more

Common Examples:
----------------

Purpose                             |         Command
----------------------------------  | ------------------------------
find all files                      | find . -type f filename
find all directory                  | find . -type d directory name
find by path                        | find /path -name filename.txt
case insensitive search             | find . -iname readme.md
find by extension                   | find . -name "*.log"
find empty files                    | find . -type f -empty
find empty directories              | find . -type d -empty
find by size >10MB                  | find . -type f -size +10M

find files deleted in last 1 day    | find . -mtime +1 -delete
find access files > 30 days ago     | find . -atime +30
If i want to find files inside root | find / -name file name
-----------------------------------------------------------------

FILE SYSTEMS:
===== ** ===== ** ======
TO Create a File In Linux  We Use Two Commands:-
They Are:
1) touch 
2) vim (or) vi Editor 

1) touch:
---------
--> touch is used to just create a file 

Syntax:
-------
--> If I want to create a single file we use command.
touch filename

--> If I want to create a two files we use command.
touch filename1 filename2

--> If I want to create a multiple files we use command.
touch filename1 filename2 filename3 

--> After Creating a File we need to enter the data inside the file we use command.

cat:
----
--> If I want to Insert a Single line inside the file we use command.
cat > filename1

--> If I want to Insert Multiple Lines inside the file we use command.
cat >> filename1

--> If I want to view content inside the file (or) Directory we use command.
cat filename1

--> If I want to overwrite the data in filename2 with filename1 we use command.
cat filename1 > filename2

--> If I want to add data to filename2 with filenmae1 we use command.
cat filenmae1 >> filename2

VIM (OR) VI EDITOR :
=== ** ==== ** =====
--> vim/vi is used to create the file along with we can insert the large amount of data at a time

Syntax:
-------
vim/vi filename4

Steps to use vim/vi Editor:
----------------------------
step-1:- Use vim/vi filename4
step-2:- Then Press "i" to get for insert mode.
step-3:- Then u can add the data whatever u want.
step-4:- After entering the data u need to press "Esc" to get out from Insert Mode.
step-5:- Then to Save the file we need to type ":wq!"(w-->save, q-->Exit) and get our from vi Editor.


--> If Suppose u enter a data in filename4 you want to add sl.no to inside the file then we use command
syntax:
-------
:set num
-->TO set sl.no.
:set nonum

--> If Suppose u enter a l000 lines of data to filenmae4 then u want to find 645 (or) any line we use command.
syntax:
-------
:645/Line number whatever u want.

--> If Suppose in filename4 I enter a mistake then I want to delete the line then we use command.
syntax:
-------
-- Go to Particular line using above command then Press "dd".

--> If Suppose u entered a wrong data in filename4 then u want to delete a whole data inside the file we use command.
syntax:
-------
>filename4
:%d

--> If Suppose u deleted a data inside the filename4 but u want to get back everything we use command.
syntax:
-------
:q!

--> If Suppose u want to find  any word inside the  filename4 from top to bottom we use command.
syntax:
-------
:/workname

--> If Suppose u want to find  any word inside the  filename4 from bottom to top we use command.
syntax:
------
:? workname

--> If Suppose u want to replace a any word in 3rd line  inside the file from vim/vi Editor we use command.
syntax:
-------
:3s/old name/newname

--> If Suppose u want to replace the any word inside the filename4 at a time we use command.
syntax:
-------
:%s/old name/newname


CREATION OF A DIRECTORY:
======== ** == ** ======
syntax:
-------
mkdir dir1     # In these it won't display the execution of created a dir1.
mkdir -v dir1  # v[verbose] will display after execution of command that it created a directory called dir1.
mkdir -p clgname/branches/sections/  # It will create the Parent directory.


--> we can create a more directory inside a directory using "mkdir" command.
--> If we want to display the hierarchy relation in directory we use command "tree".
--> Try to install tree using yum "install tree -y".
syntax:
--------
ls -lrth dir1/

USER & GROUP MANAGEMENT:
===== ** === ** ========
--> When we joined in a new Organization we need to create a User & add to a group & give permissions to user like root axis and other axis.
--> Run under a sudo axis.

user creation:
--------------
useradd -c "role" username.   # c-comment.

Ex:- useradd -c "software" suresh.

Deletion of user:
-----------------
userdel -d username

To check the  list of users:
----------------------------
cat /etc/passwd

user password:
----------------
passwd username

To check the list of Passwords:
-------------------------------
cat /etc/shadow

creation of group:
------------------
groupadd groupname

Deletion of a group:
-------------------
groupdel -d groupname

To check the list of groups:
----------------------------
cat /etc/group

Adding user to a group:
-----------------------
usermod -aG "groupname" username.

Removing user from a group:
---------------------------
gpasswd -d username groupname

To Check Group passwd:
------------------------
cat /etc/gshadow

How to lock the user:
---------------------
usermod -L username

How to unlock the user:
-----------------------
usermod -U username

--> If I want to give a user access by login into the server we use command.
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  -->move to line.no:63 -->change Authentication to "Yes" --> press :wq!

--> If I want to sudo access to user then we command.
vi sudo --> Move to line.no:100-->copy above line and add ALL.

PROCESS MANAGEMENT:
===================
Process:
--------
	A set of Instructions which executes the memory is known as Process.

-- PID - Process Id.
-- PPID - Parent Process Id.

It has six types. They are:-
1) Running Process
2) Stopping Process
3) Sleeping Process
4) Waiting Process
5) Zombie Process
6) Orphan Process

1) Running Process:
--------------------
	The process that is actively executing on the CPU.

Ex:- when you run a command like top, it is in the running state as long as it's on CPU.
----

2) Stopping Process:
--------------------
	The process that is temporarily stopped by a signal.

Ex:- ctr + z in the terminal pauses the foreground process. 
---- 

3) Sleeping Process:
---------------------
	The process that is currently not running but it is waiting for a resource or an event.

Ex:- A program waiting for a user i/p or file i/p.
----

4) Waiting Process:
--------------------
	 The process that is waiting for some resource or an event.

Ex:- A Program waiting for a user i/p or file i/p.
----

5) Zombie Process:
------------------
	 The Process is running when the child is present.

6) Orphan Process:
------------------
	The process is running when the parent is present.


Commands for Process Management:
-------------------------------

ps                   # Snapshots of current processes.
ps -ef               # parent-child relationship.
ps -aux              # A quick look at daemons and user process.

--> If I want to kill the process we use command.
kill -9 PPID


PACKAGE MANAGEMENT:
====== ** =========
--> Package Management refers to the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing software's on a system.
--> Different Linux distributions use different package managers and package formats.

| Distribution       | Package Format | Package Manager     |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Ubuntu/Debian      | `.deb`         | `apt`, `dpkg`       |
| RHEL/CentOS/Fedora | `.rpm`         | `yum`, `dnf`, `rpm` |
| Arch Linux         | -              | `pacman`            |

-- Difference between Hard Link & Soft Link

|              Hard Link                               |                      Soft Link
|-----------------------------------------              -----------------------------------------------                                       
|- Hard link is the copied file of a selected files.   |- Soft link is a file point reference to a selected file. |
|- Hard link is not work for files.                    |- Soft link will work for both.                           |
|- Hard access the data available in a original file.  |- Soft Link can't access the data in a original file.     | 
|- If I deleted Parent file child file will be present.|- If I deleted the Parent file child file will be deleted.|
|- Inode numbers are same.                             |- Inode numbers are different.                            |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SECURITY && PERMISSIONS:
======== ** ============

umask:- user file creation mode mask.

--> Default code for umask is 0022.
--> If u want u can change the Uumask like "umask 0222".
--> umask is a Linux command that sets default permissions for new files & directories.
--> umask number for Directories is "755"  & for files is "644".
--> To get this we have concept and some mathematical related.
--> The Base for directories is "0777" && for files is "0666".

BACKUP & RECOVERY:
====== ** ========

What is Backup:
---------------
A backup is a copy of data stored in another location to protect against data loss due to:
  Hardware Failures
  Human Error
  Malware
  Accidental deletion

Types of Backups:
-----------------

| Type                       |                              Description                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
